## Deadline

The deadline for Assignment 7 is **Wednesday, 8th November 2023, at 12:00 p.m**.

The teaching assistants will check the last commit of the lab assignment repository, so you do not need to submit the repository link separately.

## Bonus

You will gain bonus points in this assignment if you implement different colors for each button (`View Items`, `Add Item`, and `Logout`).
